//! Shared host-test fixtures.
//!
//! Several ported modules describe firmware objects whose pointer fields are
//! **u32 target pointers**: the port reads them with `word(..) as usize as
//! *mut u8` and dereferences the result. A host fixture backing such an
//! object must therefore live entirely below 4 GiB, or the address truncates
//! on store and the first dereference dies on SIGSEGV.
//!
//! This is a strictly stronger requirement than the one the heap slabs have
//! (`heap/pool.rs`, `heap/mod.rs`), where the only constraint is that bit 31
//! stay clear because `pool_alloc` uses it as the uncached mark. Conflating
//! the two is how `cxx/list_splice.rs`, `heap/block_mgr.rs` and
//! `heap/client_populate.rs` each shipped a bit-31 assertion that a
//! 0x1_xxxx_xxxx mapping passes happily before crashing.
//!
//! **Not every host can satisfy it.** Linux honours a low `mmap` hint. arm64
//! macOS reserves the whole low 4 GiB and refuses such a mapping even with
//! `MAP_FIXED`, so there the fixture cannot exist at all. Modules that need
//! one skip their tests on those hosts rather than crash — which is why this
//! returns an `Option` instead of asserting.
